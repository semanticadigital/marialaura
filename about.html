<p>Miriam Cabessa (Born – 1966) is an Israeli-American painter, performance and installation artist.[1] Cabessa was born in Morocco, raised in Israel, and has lived and worked in New York City since 2000. Her slow action painting has been internationally recognized since 1997 when she represented Israel at the Venice Biennale. Over the past two decades, she has abstained from using brushes, opting to make marks with objects and her body. Her imagery ranges from organic to mechanistic with surfaces that are both haptically handmade and digitally serene. Cabessa has shown extensively in the U.S., Europe, and Israel.</p>

<p>Moroccan-born Miriam Cabessa makes performative paintings with unconventional tools, her body included.  The paintings are made on the ground with Cabessa hovering over her canvas or paper; eschewing the use of paintbrushes, Cabessa uses her own hands, irons, squeegees, mops, and fabric to create a variety of abstract marks with rhythmic and repetitive motions.</p>
